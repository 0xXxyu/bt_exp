# BTstack Arduino Manual

Thanks for checking out BTstack on the Arduino platform!

In this manual, we first provide a quick tutorial that helps install the BTstack Library for the Arduino IDE and gets you started with the examples.

In the second part, we'll explain the examples to get you starting in creating your own Sketches that use the BTstack LE Arduino Shield.

## Supported Harware 

BTstack LE Arduino Shield together with Arduino boards with at least 64 kB Flash - tested with Arduino.cc IDE v1.6.4:

- Arduino Mega 2560 R3
- Arduino Mega 2560 
- Arduino Mega 1280 
- Sparkfun Mega 3.3

It should work with any board that provides 64 kB Flash and a working SPI driver, please let us know if you get it working with your hardware.
