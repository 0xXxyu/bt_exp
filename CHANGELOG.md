- SM: allow to set fixed passkey in display role using sm_use_fixed_passkey_in_display_role
- Example/hid_host_demo with HID parser and support for basic US keyboard layout
- EM9304: custom HCI Transport implementation for EM9304 on top of btstack_em9304_spi.h platform abstraction only requires hal_em9304_spi.h to be implemented for new ports
