In the following, we provide more information on specific platform setups, toolchains, programmers, and init scripts.

\subsubsection{Texas Instruments MSP430-based boards}

\emph{Compiler Setup} The MSP430 port of BTstack is developed using the Long Term Support (LTS) version of mspgcc. General information about it and installation instructions are provided on the \MSPGCCWiki{}. On Windows, you need to download and extract \mspgcc{} to \path{C:\mspgcc}. Add \path{C:\mspgcc\bin} folder to the Windows Path in Environment variable as explained in Section \ref{sec:windowsPath}.

\emph{Loading Firmware} To load firmware files onto the MSP430 MCU, you need a programmer like the MSP430 MSP-FET430UIF debugger or something similar. Now, you can use one of following software tools:

 \begin{itemize}
 \item  \MSPFlasher{} (windows-only):
 	\begin{itemize}
 	   \item Use the following command, where you need to replace the \path{BINARY_FILE_NAME.hex} with the name of your application:
	\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
	
	   \begin{lstlisting}
 		MSP430Flasher.exe -n MSP430F5438A -w "BINARY_FILE_NAME.hex" -v -g -z [VCC]
	   \end{lstlisting}

 \begin{itemize}
	
	\item \MSPDebug{}: An example session with the MSP-FET430UIF connected on OS X is given in following listing:
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
mspdebug -j -d /dev/tty.FET430UIFfd130 uif
... 
prog blink.hex
run
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Texas Instruments CC256x-based chipsets}
\emph{CC256x Init Scripts} In order to use the CC256x chipset on the PAN13xx modules and others, an initialization script must be obtained. Due to licensing restrictions, this initialization script must be obtained separately as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download the \BTSfile{} for your PAN13xx module.
\item Copy the included .bts file into \path{btstack/chipset-cc256x}
\item In \path{chipset-cc256x}, run the Python script: $./convert\_bts\_init\_scripts.py$
\end{itemize}

The common code for all CC256x chipsets is provided by $bt\_control\_cc256x.c$. During the setup, $bt\_control\_cc256x\_instance$ function is used to get  a $bt\_control\_t$ instance and passed to $hci\_init$ function. 

Note: Depending on the PAN13xx module you're using, you'll need to update the reference \path{bluetooth_init_cc256...} in the Makefile to match the downloaded file.

Update: For the latest revision of the CC256x chipsets, the CC2560B and CC2564B, TI decided to split the init script into a main part and the BLE part. The conversion script has been updated to detect $blueooth\_init\_cc256x\_1.2.bts$ and adds $BLE\_init\_cc256x\_1.2.bts$ if present and merges them into a single .c file.

\subsubsection{MSP-EXP430F5438 + CC256x Platform}
\label{platform:msp430}
\emph{Hardware Setup} We assume that a PAN1315, PAN1317, or PAN1323 module is plugged into RF1 and RF2 of the MSP-EXP430F5438 board and the "RF3 Adapter board" is used or at least simulated. See \UserGuide{}.
